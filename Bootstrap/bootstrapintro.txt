Bootstrap is a free, open-source front-end framework used to quickly design and develop responsive and mobile-first websites. It was originally created by Twitter developers Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton and is now maintained by the open-source community.

Key Features

Websites automatically adjust layout and content to fit different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Pre-designed Components

Ready-to-use elements like buttons, navigation bars, forms, modals, alerts, carousels, etc.

CSS Utility Classes

Classes for margins, padding, colors, font styles, borders, and more — no need to write custom CSS for common styles.

Grid System

A 12-column flexible layout system for arranging content in rows and columns.

Cross-browser Compatibility

Works well in all modern browsers.

JavaScript Plugins

Prebuilt interactive elements like dropdowns, sliders, modals, tooltips, etc., using JavaScript .

Why Use Bootstrap?
Faster development — no need to write every style from scratch.

Consistency — all UI components look uniform.

Mobile-first approach — prioritizes mobile design before scaling up to desktop.

Customizable — you can use only the parts you need.
